# Outsmart A Robot Clicky Game

Test your memory with this image tile game! When you click on an image, all the image tiles reshuffle themselves in a clever attempt to confuse you. Make sure you don't fall for this trap by clicking on the same tile over again. Every time you outsmart the game you'll earn a point. Careful, click on the same image and a robot jumps out of the screen and stabs you in the chest for Game Over. Just kidding, robots love humans, you just have to start over again (they're forcing me to say that).

### This App Development
This is my first app using React, and I love how intituive and easy using components are.
